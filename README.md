# image-recognition-project

Preface: I challenged myself to attempt an image recognition task despite not having any prior 
experience with the forementioned skill.

You're a Computer Vision engineer and a client reaches out to you with a unique
problem. They have a dataset of images where each of them contains different shapes
randomly placed throughout. These shapes are selected from a set of three basic shapes -
circle, square, and triangle. The client wants an algorithm that counts how many of each shape
are in a given image. In order to test the performance of your algorithm, the client has provided
you with a sample dataset of 100 images along with the ground truth annotations for all the
images in the dataset. These annotations contain the count for each of the shapes in all the
images. The dataset along with the annotation file can be downloaded from here. You are free
to select the framework (deep learning or classical computer vision techniques) of your choice
for the development of this algorithm. The dataset provided is only to evaluate the performance
of your algorithm. You are allowed to generate your own dataset if you plan to use a supervised
approach to build your algorithm before evaluating its performance on the sample dataset
provided by the client.
